      "message": "typically, this is needed for code coverage.  However, PfKeyImpl (and its superclasses) define equals() to be abstract, so you are correct, lines 167-169 could be deleted, as they only test MyKey.equals, which is unnecessary.\n\nFor the next file, PfKeyUseTest.java, this is needed for coverage tests as equals() typically has an explicit check for \"this \u003d\u003d other\"... except that PfKeyUse.equals() is implemented by lombok, so coverage doesn\u0027t matter.  Nevertheless, in that case, it\u0027s OK to leave the tests there, in case we ever change the definition of PfKeyUse.equals().",
