      "message": "there\u0027s a (very slight) possibility that the execution thread can change the response value after this timeout value has been set and before the \"return\" occurs.  I think that\u0027s ok, as the only real downside I can see is that the message that is logged here may not be reflected by the invoking code, as the invoker will actually get a valid response.\n\nAnother option would be to use compareAndSet(null, xxx) through-out, and then use get() to retrieve the correct status for logging.  This would avoid race conditions that might occur as the code is modified in the future.",
