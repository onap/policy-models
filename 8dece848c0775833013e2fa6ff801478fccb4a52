      "message": "good question, in essence no change in this file, just formatting I leaked here.\nthe A1pActor use the same SdnrOperation class as SdnrActor.  It\ndoes not inherit from SdnrActor (it was giving me some trouble when I tried it out).\nThe A1pOperation does inherit from SdnrOperation and all that code  from SdnrOperation\nis pretty much reused.\nSo, here it just calls the 2-arguments super constructor from Bidirectional...  \nAs a note, at runtime both actors use the same Operations and message format but over different topics.   I couldn\u0027t figure out a better way than creating another actor to go through\ndifferent request/response topics.   Here is the a1p constructor for convenience comparing it:\n\npublic class A1pActor extends BidirectionalTopicActor\u003cBidirectionalTopicActorParams\u003e\n..\n    public A1pActor() {\n        super(NAME, BidirectionalTopicActorParams.class);\n\n        addOperator(new BidirectionalTopicOperator(NAME, SdnrOperation.NAME, this, SdnrOperation.SELECTOR_KEYS,\n            A1pOperation::new));\n    }",
