      "message": "I\u0027ve seen the Pattern object being cached, in theory the compile operation being expensive.   One idea, is to have an api (new default method in this interface) to accept a Pattern or Matcher.   This would allow callers to cache it on their side for reuse.    The other idea is to change the \"String pattern\" argument to this method, to force library clients to think about it, and seriously considering the caching on their side.",

      "message": "At least with this approach, it only compiles the pattern once  before applying the pattern to a list, rather than compiling it for every item in the list.  For that matter, either way adds negligible overhead, as the vast majority of time is spent just retrieving the data from the DB.\n\nFor the particular case of matching versions, it would actually have been easier to use startsWith(), but this seemed a little more flexible.  I\u0027d still be open to changing matchVersion to startsWithVersion since that\u0027s really what is wanted, thus avoiding the pattern compilation altogether.",
