      "message": "OK, I have tried a different approach.\n\nIt would be nice to create a subclass of ToscaConceptIdentifierOptVersion that would handle the different names for serialization/deserialization of the policy identifier name/version \"policy-id\" and \"policy-version\" used on the PAP-PDP communication. However, this can\u0027t be done  because the only name to change the @SerializedName would to be to introduce new name/version fields on the subclass and this would shadow the name/version fields in the base class.\n\nSo what I ahve done instead is to introduce a new class called PapPolicyIdentifier in models-pap. This class acts as a serialization/deserialization class for the ToscaConceptIdentifierOptVersion class. It is used to serialize and deserailze the messages on the PAP/PDP communication and is used as the members on the PdpDeployPolicies class. Have a look at that class to see what you think of that.",
