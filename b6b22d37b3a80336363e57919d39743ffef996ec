      "message": "Thanks Ramesh, I am looking though for a full policy that can be used as is and deploy for apex and that points to this policy type reference.   Something that shows how a whole policy can be composed and reuse the implementation.    This will also provide a sample to other components if they want to follow this mode of composing policies this way.   We would need documentation as well going under policy/parent docs to describe its usage too if you could add as an item to the ticket.",
