      "message": "Need to think this through - and review the WIP I had started. I believe when a service is \"retrieved\" via java.util service API there is one instance of that class returned. So, if we were to support multiple instances of a control loop event happening, then you wouldn\u0027t want to local variables like this. But rather have saved in memory one object per event. This allows for multi-threading etc. \n\nSee this review: https://gerrit.onap.org/r/c/policy/models/+/91882\n\nstartOperation is the method to kick things off. An object such as ControlLoopOperation would contain variables specific to the event (eg Policy, AAI details, response, requestId, subRequestId).",
