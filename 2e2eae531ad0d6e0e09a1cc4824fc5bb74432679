      "message": "Should \"Not applicable\" be treated as success, or as failure?  Perhaps I should define a set of success values and a set of failure values and then just do a look-up instead of using equals() comparison.  Is there a place where the possible values are defined?  At this point, anything it doesn\u0027t recognize is treated as a \"DENY\".",

      "message": "In my opinion, \"Not applicable\" means we screwed up in writing the policies. More along the lines of a bug. In production we should never get NA, but it is remotely possible to get Indeterminate - eg. the request may be missing attributes. Could be also considered a \"bug\".\n\nWhat we have been doing is defaulting any other than Permit is a Deny. Just to be safe. And best if we can propogate details as to why (but we need to pass that information from xacml pdp back - another Pam TODO) so someone can either push or modify a guard policy that remedies the situation.",
