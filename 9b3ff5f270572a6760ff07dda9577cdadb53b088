      "message": "this much could be done using automatic tools.  However, it was very tempting to take this a step further since all of the extracted methods are the same (except for a few simple parameter differences), but that would have entailed manual changes which would have left the possibility of introducing a new bug.  We\u0027ll see if sonar now complains about duplicated code; if it does, then I guess we\u0027ll go ahead with that change anyway.",
