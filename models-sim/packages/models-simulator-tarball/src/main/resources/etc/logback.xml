        This is only used for testing and only a snapshot docker image is generated,
        thus it is not necessary for the messages to following the ONAP standard.
        Therefore, keeping it short so it's easier to wade through the output.
        
        Also sending all output to stdout instead of to a log file; it can be viewed
        via "docker logs" or captured by kubernetes.
