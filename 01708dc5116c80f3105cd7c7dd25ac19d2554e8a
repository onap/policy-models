      "message": "so the way this is written, it does not do any polling.  However, I seem to recall some code extracting the jobId - typically, code only extracts the jobId if it\u0027s going to use it to poll.  Are we sure this won\u0027t be polling?",

      "message": "Yes Jim. There were some complications in implementing the job status api in SO. So, it was decided not to poll the SO for this release. So, the control loop will be in a best effort basis for this release. May be, I need to make a note of it somewhere so that we can track it.",
